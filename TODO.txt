SETTING IS NOT GETTING UPDATED

This is why defaults aren't being enforced.

=====================
Shadows: https://doc.babylonjs.com/babylon101/shadows

Whenever a light appears, add a shadow caster. Add all objects as shadow casters.

Whenever an object appears, add it to the shadow caster.

How do I manage this?

===================
Beams:

Draw as a line?
https://doc.babylonjs.com/babylon101/parametric_shapes#lines

Draw as a particle system?

How to keep track of the mesh between shots? (attach mesh to weapon rather than projectile?)
(what to do about collider?)

=================
FTL Effects

Figure out how to hand off control to the autopilot

Figure out how to affect all star sprites at once

Autopilot player to right direction

Rotate stars to match player movement

Stretch stars

Change background color or add other effects (fullscreen shader?)

================
Map Markers

Show systems that are mission destinations on the map somehow
