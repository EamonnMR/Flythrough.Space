Textures:
https://doc.babylonjs.com/babylon101/materials#texture
Enumerate textures in model metadata

Inside graphics.js set textures directly when initializing an object's material

==================
Shadows: https://doc.babylonjs.com/babylon101/shadows

Whenever a light appears, add a shadow caster. Add all objects as shadow casters.

Whenever an object appears, add it to the shadow caster.

How do I manage this?

===================
Beams:

Draw as a line?
https://doc.babylonjs.com/babylon101/parametric_shapes#lines

Draw as a particle system?

How to keep track of the mesh between shots? (attach mesh to weapon rather than projectile?)
(what to do about collider?)

================
Map Markers

Show systems that are mission destinations on the map somehow

===============
AI/ Turrets

Add unit tests, figure out just how wrong the math is
