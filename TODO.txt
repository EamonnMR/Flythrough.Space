==================
Modeling And Texturing Tut: Write a how-to blog post to codify
the knowledge of how to make ships.

==================
Disappearing Particle Systems:
The Behavior:
It appears that any time any particle system is disposed,
they all quit working, including newly created ones.
Things I've Tried:
* Object.create(ParticleSystem) (before and after the Object.assign)
* Giving each system a unique name
* Manually doing Object.assign (ie iterating over stuff)
Observations:
They get init'd as started=true, stopped=true, but manually setting started=false
seems to have no effect.
Further Thoughts:
I'd like a clean way to diff the objects before and after. JSON.stringify does
not work, but maybe copy/pasting from the debugger, cleaning up the garbage,
and alpha-sorting will allow a clean enough diff.
If there's no difference that can be shown between the objects, I think it's
time to make a forum post.

==================
Shadows: https://doc.babylonjs.com/babylon101/shadows

Whenever a light appears, add a shadow caster. Add all objects as shadow casters.

Whenever an object appears, add it to the shadow caster.

How do I manage this?

===================
Beams:

Draw as a line?
https://doc.babylonjs.com/babylon101/parametric_shapes#lines

Draw as a particle system?

How to keep track of the mesh between shots? (attach mesh to weapon rather than projectile?)
(what to do about collider?)

================
Map Markers

Show systems that are mission destinations on the map somehow

===============
AI/ Turrets

Add unit tests, figure out just how wrong the math is
