===================
Disappearing Particles

So I tried to use JSON transerialize to deepcopy the prototype
objects for particles, and realized that it can't be marshalled
because it's got a cyclic object reference. This apprears to be
from particleTexture. It's possible that the particleTexture
is what's being disposed, or otherwise messed up?

==================

Shadows: https://doc.babylonjs.com/babylon101/shadows

Whenever a light appears, add a shadow caster. Add all objects as shadow casters.

Whenever an object appears, add it to the shadow caster.

How do I manage this?

===================
Beams:

Draw as a line?
https://doc.babylonjs.com/babylon101/parametric_shapes#lines

Draw as a particle system?

How to keep track of the mesh between shots? (attach mesh to weapon rather than projectile?)
(what to do about collider?)

=================
FTL Effects

Figure out how to hand off control to the autopilot

Autopilot player to right direction

Change background color or add other effects (fullscreen shader?)

================
Map Markers

Show systems that are mission destinations on the map somehow

===============
AI/ Turrets

Add unit tests, figure out just how wrong the math is (and it
seems pretty well wrong)
